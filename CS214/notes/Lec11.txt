void foo(int n, int array[]) { //Really passing a pointer 
     sizeof(array) //size of the pointer array
}

Global/Local variable instead of 
int array[5];
sizeof(array); //20

int *array = malloc(sizeof(int)*5);
sizeof(array); //8

Overhead
Memory for metadata, processes

Reduce overhead
Malloc chunk of bytes
Have one header for metadata which reduces overhead
Allocation pool - constant time, nearly zero overhead
If out of space malloc more
But the caveat is that malloc is called in the worst case scenario 
So 1 chunk of allocated memory with 1 header - low overhead
Useful for linked list, binary tree, specialized memory

Processes, fork
process-running program with 1.code 2.state
ps - list current processes associated with your user
top - list all processes on machine
kill -9 pid# //kills anything lul

exec - replace current process with new process
fork - clone current process, returns twice
differences: address space, process ids,
same: file descriptors, signal handlers

shell forks and its child execs process
return values: 0 or child pid

Ch11 sockets
Ch12 pthreads

what is a thread?
process that shares heap different stack

posix thread
pthread_t thread id - what is it? probably a int; who knows

how a thread begins
pthread_create(address of variable to store pthread_id, attributes,
		       function, argument)
returns integer

terminates thread immediatley
pthread_exit(pointer to return value)

implicitly end a thread when fnction returns

wait for threadid to end; store return value
pthread_join(threadid, &returnvalue)

send a signal to a thread
pthread_kill(threadid, signal)

thread cannot be joined
pthread_detach( threadid )

mutex_t mute;
pthread_mutex_init(&mut)
two important things
lock

pthread_mutex_unlock(&mut)

void do(arg)
     lock
     do
     unlock

all uses of do never interfere with each other in threads

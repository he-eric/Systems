why lisp.cs.rutgers.edu <-> 128.1.1.1 because easy to remember
domain name series of names ended by periods
arranged in order from most specific to least specific
last component of domain name is the top level domain
edu
com
gov
org
us, ru, br...

A for address; ip address

query lisa.cs.rutgers.edu
local domain name server -> its dns -> ... -> edu dns
until A record is found

getaddrinfo("www.xxx.com", "portno", ...) -> talk to dns server
why is a portno involved
dont have to; just give service name: SMTP
sockaddress struct will fill out portno given service name

socket(protocol domain, type, protocol) return an integer!
-----------get back a file descriptor
-----------but what are file descriptor? what does it mean to hold a fd?
-----it means its something I can use for read write close
-----a fd can be seen as a place; a object
--read(7, buf, amount) look up 7 in table
